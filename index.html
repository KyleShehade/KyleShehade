            <p>My work is a collection of pieces from my experiences from the world. These experiences have not only shaped me as an artist but also as a human being. Some of the art forms that I have explored in include Photogphery, Film, Digital Art and Screen Printing.</p>

<p>For me personally there are many ways that I utilize photography and image making. Right now, the biggest way that I utilize photography is as a form of documentation. This comes in many different forms as sometimes I ill major events in my life like people’s birthdays or holidays get together. Another way that I utilize photography and image making is to share with others. This is done while I am doing something and I think that someone else would like to see it or I want to share the moment with them, so I photographed it and then I sent it to them. In addition, I can use photography to reflect the type of mood that I am in. If I am in a sociable mood, I would be more likely to photograph with other people. While on the other hand if I am in a less sociable mood, I would be more likely to photograph the environment around me instead. Also, I utilize photography to help preserve moments in my life. This can range from big things like helping preserve the memory of a once in a life time trip or to something like a beautiful sunset that I saw.</P>
<p>There are multiple different ways that I could represent visually through photography or illustration or the combination of image and text notions of our world at this moment. One of the ways that I could do that is by capturing what is happening around me. This could be from something as simple as just photographing my commute to school or bigger things like large history altering events. Another practice that I could put into effect while I am photographing is the practice of being authentic with my work. This will help visually represent the world in the moment because it won’t create a false narrative of what the world used to once be once those photos are being looked back at, upon a latter date. In addition, I could also photograph these, “once in a lifetime events” to illustrate the world in that moment. These,” once in a lifetime events” that can range from anything from a social trend that is currently very popular or even a major event that is currently happening in the world and photographing that. Also having a deeper understanding of the subject matter that I am photographing will be able to better help me visually represent the world correctly. This is because grasping what I am photographing will make it easier for me when I go to write the description for the photo, as well as make it a more concise and more accurate description for the photos that were taken.</p>
